<!-- ngModel is a directive, that in this case, name is an attribute of the AppComponentClass, and it can be used because
of the FormsModule imported on the app.module, when i say that the input has the ngModel attribute with the component class
when i change that input, it will also change the property -->

<!-- <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="name">
<p>{{name}}</p> -->



<h3>I'm in the app component</h3>
