  ngClassDirective

  ngClass allows us to dinamically add or remove css classes. When we use it, we also need to property bind it, so we
  need to add the square brackets to it and pass a js object, we also have key value pairs, the keys are the css class
  names,  and the values are the conditions to whether this class should be applied or not

[ngClass]="{online: serverStatus === 'online'}"
>{{'Server'}} with ID {{serverId }} is {{getServerStatus()}}</p>
