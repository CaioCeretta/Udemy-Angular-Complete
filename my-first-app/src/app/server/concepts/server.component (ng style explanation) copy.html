  ngStyle directive

The ngStyle directive in Angular allows for dynamic styling of HTML elements. Unlike structural directives, it does not
require an asterisk prefix as it does not alter the DOM structure. Instead, it utilizes square brackets to indicate
property binding, enabling dynamic evaluation of styles based on component properties. With ngStyle, styles are bound to
 an object in the component class, where keys represent style properties and values represent their corresponding values.

 Property binding is completely different, in this case we are binding to a property of the directive

 ngStyle expects to receive a js object and we define key: value pairs of the style name as the key and the value as the
 value

 [ngStyle]="{'background-color': getColor(), color: 'anycolor'}" or [ngStyle]="{backgroundColor: getColor(), color: 'anycolor'}"

 so this is making clear that within the quotation marks, we are executing ts code, so therefore we can of course call a
 method

 So for a summary

 ngStyle is an attribute directive, added as an attribute, and in this case, also using property binding to configure it
-->

<p [ngStyle]="{'background-color': getColor(), color: 'white'}">{{'Server'}} with ID {{serverId }} is {{getServerStatus()}}</p>
