<!-- Databinding 1 - String Interpolation
  Here i'm getting these variables from the ts class
  Even though the string interpolation needs to resolve into a string, the number property, because a number can easily
  be converted into a string

  this method, which returns the this.serverStatus also is ok, because it returns the number and the number gets
  converted to string
-->

<p>Server with ID {{serverId}} is {{getServerStatus()}} </p>
