<!--
  First we need to add the forms module to the one that is using two data binding

  To use it, we combine property and event binding, we use them by combining the syntaxes, square brackets and within
  these, parentheses, such as

  [(ngModel)]="propertyName"

  So it will do the following

  it will trigger on the input event, and update the value of serverName in our ts code automatically, and because it
  is a two way binding, it will also update the value of the html element


-->



<!-- without two way binding-->

<!-- <input type="text" class="form-control" (input)="onUpdateServerName($event)"> -->


<!-- with two way binding -->

<input type="text" class="form-control" [(ngModel)]="serverName">



<!-- Here we can see that the element which is using the two way binding, the value of the ts, replicates on the input
value, where it doesn't happen the same on the one with just event binding, that one will only change the value of the ts
variable -->


<p class="my-5">{{serverName}}</p>
<br>

<button
class="btn btn-primary mb-3"
[disabled]="!allowNewServer"
(click)="onCreateServer()">
  Add Server
</button>

<p>{{serverCreationStatus}}</p>


<div class="servers mt-5">
  <app-server></app-server>
  <app-server></app-server>
</div>
