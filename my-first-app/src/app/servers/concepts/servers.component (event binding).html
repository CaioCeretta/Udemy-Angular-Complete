<!-- Here we are binding to the input event, an event that fires whenever the user types something on the input
and we are binding the function onUpdateServerName

And in this case, we want to output what the user typed on the input, the value of the field, we can get it by passing
the $event on the argument, the $event is a reserved variable name that we can use in the template when using event
binding, so for this event, only in this event, $event will simply be the data emmitted with that event,

Every event provided by the DOM, ship some data when they are fired, the click event holds the coordinates of where the
clicked was, and the input event also gives us some data, and with the $event, we can capture this data and
-->

<label>Server Name</label>
<input type="text" class="form-control pb-2" (input)="onUpdateServerName($event)">

{{serverName}}


<!--
  Like property binding uses square brackets, event binding utilizes parentheses.

  Between the parentheses, we need to pass the name of the event, for example "click" and we can basically bind to all
  the events, made avaiable, by the HTML attribute we are placing them on.

  In that case, we binded the click with a method, but it doesn't always have to be a method, between the quotation marks
  we can put any ts code that we want to execute when that action was made, often times, it is not very good, because we
  want to execute more code when some event happens.
