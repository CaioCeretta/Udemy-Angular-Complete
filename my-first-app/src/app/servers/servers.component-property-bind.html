Now i'm using property binding, which gets a value from a property in ts and react to it on our html file

<!-- the [disabled] attribute is now dynamic, we need to enclose it into [], square brackets indicate to angular that we
are using property binding and we want to dinamically bind some property of the ts, so the html attribute disabled, in
normal HTML, it only sets the specific property in the DOM element, each element that we use is parsed by the browser, and
translated into the DOM, and therefore we have an element in this DOM and those elements have a couple of properties.
A lot of these can be set through attributes in the HTML element, and one of those properties is the disabled prop

But here we are not using the disable attribute anymore, with the [] we are directly binding to this native disabled
property this html element has, so now we can set that equal to the property name, it will resolve to true or false, and
would disable if it's false and enable if it's true

One important note is to not mix property binding and string interpolation, we might notice that in the example below
we have the [disabled]="propertyName" there are not curly braces between these quotation marks and there should not be,
because that would break the app and that would not work, between the quotation marks of property binding, we can and
must write typescript expressions which will return the value this property expects, so for disabled, some expressions
would return true or false



-->

<button
class="btn btn-primary"
[disabled]="!allowNewServer">
Add Server
</button>

<!-- And if we want to output the value of allowNewServer, we could of course utilize string interpolation in this way
a boolean can also be cast to a string  -->
<!-- <p>{{allowNewServer}}</p>
OR
This would cause the same behaviour as before
-->

<p [innerText]="allowNewServer"></p>


<app-server></app-server>
<app-server></app-server>
<app-server></app-server>
